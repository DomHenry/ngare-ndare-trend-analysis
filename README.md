An analysis of change in VCF MODIS data for the Ngare Ndare forest.

VCF bands include:
* Percentage tree cover
* Percentage non-tree vegetation cover
* Percentage bare ground cover

*Note about Google Drive and Git:*

Drive creates `desktop.ini` files all over the show and Git does not like this. Pulling from remote results in the following error: “fatal: bad object refs/desktop.ini”

To get around this the only (hacky) way is to go into project folder, search for all `desktop.ini` files and delete them in explorer. Alternatively there is code to search for all files and delete them using Python.
